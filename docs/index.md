Welcome!!!

Inspired by the idea of
[The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind)

I've noted down my grinding journey as a software developer.

Software engineer normally read more, grind more technologies and then use less and elegant code in work. The best career is a pursuit of craftsmanship spirit.

Happy coding!
Happy life!

Working In Progress!!!
